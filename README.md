## Introduction
Financial data can often be susceptible to anomalies due to fraudulent activities or errors. This project focuses on preprocessing financial data and detecting such anomalies using various data science techniques.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.6 or later installed on your local machine
- Jupyter Notebook installed
- Basic knowledge of Python and data analysis

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NikhilOO7/Anomaly-Detection-in-Financial-Data.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Anomaly-Detection-in-Financial-Data
    ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Data\ Preprocessing\ and\ Anomalies\ Detection.ipynb
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data and detect anomalies.
